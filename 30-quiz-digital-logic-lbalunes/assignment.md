1. On a scratch piece of paper, draw the circuit for a 1-to-2 decoder.  This decoder should have two inputs: A and E; with two outputs: X and Y. Provide the Boolean expression for X and Y.
   * X:
     -                                     <!-- response -->
   * Y:
     -                                     <!-- response -->

1. A mux (multiplexer) is a type of digital device.  Briefly describe the purpose or use of this type of device within a CPU.  Your answer should include some information related to your knowledge of the MIPS architecture.

1. Simplify the following Boolean expression.

   - A'B'C + A'B'C' + ABC

   You answer, below, needs so show each step in the simplification process and also identify the property your used on each step.

1. Given the following Boolean algebra expression, provide both the one-d and two-d truth table. (In this question, you need not worry about the response tags.)

   *  A*(B' + C)                                    

   1. the one-d truth table

      |  A |  B |  C | Output |
      |----|----|----| ------ |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |
      |  x |  x |  x |   x    |

   1. the two-d truth table

      |   |   | BC <br> xx | BC <br> xx | BC <br> xx | BC <br> xx | 
      |---|---|     --     |     --     |     --     |     --     | 
      | x | x |     x      |     x      |     x      |     x      | 
      | x | x |     x      |     x      |     x      |     x      | 


1. Consider the following MIPS code.

   ```mips
         li $s1, 5
         li $s2, -5
         beq  $s1, $s2, skip
           addi $t2, $t4, $t6
           lw $s2, 8($t2)
   skip: nop
         li $t2, 2
   ```

   What is the value of the PC after the `beq` instruction is executed?

   - PC:       <!-- response -->

   <!-- If you think you can NOT answer this question because you don't have a specific value for the PC, then you need to remember you can treat PC like a variable.  -->
