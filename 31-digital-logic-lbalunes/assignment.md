### Microarchitecture

1. A CPU is an example of a sequential circuit, where different parts of the circuit is executed in well defined steps.  Answer the following questions related to such a sequential circuit.
   1. For the MIPS microarchitcture, enumerate and describe briefly what each of these steps does:
      1. Fetch: PC is incremented by 4, and the next instruction is read from main memory.                            <!-- response -->

1. In the MIPS micro-architecture, the PC is incremented for each instruction, during the "Instruction Fetch" stage.  The value of the PC may also be updated later within the "Memory Access" phase.
