### Microarchitecture

1. A CPU is an example of a sequential circuit, where different parts of the circuit is executed in well defined steps.  Answer the following questions related to such a sequential circuit.
   1. For the MIPS microarchitcture, enumerate and describe briefly what each of these steps does:
      1. Fetch: PC is incremented by 4, and the next instruction is read from main memory.                        <!-- response -->
      1. Decode: will be used in instruction register to know what it's being asked to do.                      <!-- response -->

      1. Write back: Put back into register after the previous 4 steps are completed.
      <!-- Feel free to add or remove additional response lines as needed. -->
 
   1. What type of digital component is used between each of these steps?
      *  latches is the digital component used between each steps.                                <!-- response -->
