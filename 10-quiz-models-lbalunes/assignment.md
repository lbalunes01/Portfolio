1. The OSI/ISO and TCP/IP models are closely aligned, where the OSI/ISO model is more theoretical and TCP/IP is a practical implementation of a subset of the OSI/ISO model.  These two models help us to better understand how messages can be effectively sent between to computers.  Answer the following questions:

   1. At which layer is the `http` protocol associated?
      *                                                   <!-- response -->

   1. At which layer is a MAC address used to name a communication end-point?
      *                                                   <!-- response -->

   1. What layer is only concerned with the mechanism to send symbols (e.g., electric impulses) over some medium.
      *                                                   <!-- response -->

   1. What layer is used to support the communication that performed by a USB hub?
      *                                                   <!-- response -->

   1. What layer is used to ensure that a message that is sent is actually received by the intended receiver.
      *                                                   <!-- response -->

1. The Process Status Diagram is used to model the life-cycle of a process.  This diagram contains the five states in which a process can be in.  Enumerate the names of each of these states:
