## Overview
The goal of this assignment is:
  1. to provide you with a little bit of exposure to a [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org)
  1. to garner some introductory information about you, and 
  1. to ensure you understand the mechanics of submitting assignments.

Note that spacing is very important to ensure your document is rendered correctly on the web.
You should review what this page looks like with a markdown viewer, e.g., One Markdown.

In this assignment, fake answers have been provided. You should replace the provided answers with your own.

#### Section One
1. Enumerate your top four favorite subjects in college:
   1. Intro to sarcasm                                                        <!-- response -->
   1. Advance microsurgery                                                    <!-- response -->
   1. Procrastination Studies                                                 <!-- response -->
   <!-- A '1. ' introduces an ordered list.  
        To add the fourth subject, simple add a line to the list 
        starting with '1. '. the Markdown viewer will automatically 
        assigned the appropriate line number. Also note that positioning 
        of all the '1. 's that are part of the answer; they are all begin
        in the same column number. 
   -->
 

1. What is your major?
   > Basket weaving                                                           <!-- response -->
   <!-- Place your response after the '> '.  A '> ' introduce a 
        block quote.  Also note that the '> ' is positioned directly 
        under the first character after the '1. ' above.  This is 
        important.
   -->


1. Provide a list of possible positions you would like to obtain after graduation.
   * Bottle washer                                                            <!-- response -->

  <!-- This is an example of an unordered list.  An unordered list can
       begin with either '* ' or '- '.  Feel free to add and delete 
       response lines as needed.

     Application Developer and there is no need for me to waste               <!-- response -->
     my time to learn anything else.                                          <!-- response -->
     else.                                                                    <!-- response -->

#### Section Three
1. Modify the following Java method, `sum4`, to include the fourth 
   formal parameter.

   ```java
   static int add4(int a, int b, int c) {                                     
     int sum=0;

     sum = a + b + c;

     return sum;
   }
   ```
   <!-- The three ticks ('`') open up a code block. You can also include
        the tag (e.g., java) that identifies how to render the code.
        All the code must be between the two sets of 3-ticks, and the code
        must also be lined up.
        For code blocks, I don't expect you to include any "response" tags.
   -->
